			<li>Dongyoon Lee, Communication Design, Junior</li>
			<li>I am from Korea, and I am interested in advertising design. I am taking this class because I have to, but it seems interesting and fun. AND HARD.</li>
			<li>No, it's my first experience with HTML/CSS/JS. I don't even know what CSS and JS are.</li>
			<li>How to make a 'fancy' webpage.</li>
			<li>Designing for screen is interactive with the technology, so it has to consider screen communication while paper design does not have to.</li>
			<li><a href="https://www.apple.com/?afid=p238%7CseIEs444j-dc_mtid_1870765e38482_pcrid_356030251809_pgrid_13945964887_&cid=aos-us-kwgo-brand--slid---apple-e-product-">Apple</a>I think Apple website is effectively designed using the theme color of the company and putting the on-sale or the new products on the main banner.</li>
			<li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/?tag=amazusnavi-20&hvadid=261614678572&hvpos=1t1&hvnetw=g&hvrand=2855973796582339845&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=e&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9022867&hvtargid=kwd-10573980&ref=pd_sl_7j18redljs_e&hydadcr=28883_11375890&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIqYD-i4O25AIVJ__jBx3CjAbXEAAYASAAEgLh4_D_BwE">Amazon</a>Amazon website is effective in communication by providing information about 'Deal of the Day' and recommended items right on to the face when one opens the website.</li>
			<li><a href="https://wustl.instructure.com/">Canvas</a>I think Canvas website works well (for the students) because it is easy to find the courses that the students are currently taking and the lists are on the left side. This design is consistent when one clicks on to the course fron the dashboard making easier for the students to use the website.</li>
