				Make way for Prince Ali <br> 
				Say hey! It's Prince Ali
			</p>
			<div>
				Hey! Clear the way in the old Bazaar<br>
				Hey you!<br>
				Let us through!<br>
				It's a bright new star!<br>
				Oh Come!<br>
				Be the first on your block to meet his eye!<br>
			</div>
			<div>
				Make way!<br>
				Here he comes!<br>
				Ring bells! Bang the drums!<br>
				Are you gonna love this guy!<br>
			</div>
			<div>
				Prince Ali! Fabulous he!<br>
				Ali Ababwa<br>
				Genuflect, show some respect<br>
				Down on one knee!<br>
				Now, try your best to stay calm<br>
				Brush up your sunday salaam<br>
				The come and meet his spectacular coterie<br>
			</div>
			<div>
				Prince Ali!<br>
				Mighty is he!<br>
				Ali Ababwa<br>
				Strong as ten regular men, definitely!<br>
				He faced the galloping hordes<br>
				A hundred bad guys with swords<br>
				Who sent those goons to their lords?<br>
				Why, Prince Ali<br>
			</div>
			<div>
				He's got seventy-five golden camels<br>
				Purple peacocks<br>
				He's got fifty-three<br>
				When it comes to exotic-type mammals<br>
				Has he got a zoo?<br>
				I'm telling you, it's a world-class menagerie<br>
			</div>
			<div>
				Prince Ali! Handsome is he, Ali Ababwa<br>
				That physique! How can I speak<br>
				Weak at the knee<br>
				Well, get on out in that square<br>
				Adjust your veil and prepare<br>
				To gawk and grovel and stare at Prince Ali!<br>
			</div>
			<div>
				He's got ninety-five white Persian monkeys<br>
				(He's got the monkeys, let's see the monkeys)<br>
				And to view them he charges no fee<br>
				(He's generous, so generous)<br>
				He's got slaves, he's got servants and flunkies<br>
				(Proud to work for him)<br>
				They bow to his whim love serving him<br>
				They're just lousy with loyalty to Ali! Prince Ali!<br>
			</div>
			<div>
				Prince Ali!<br>
				Amorous he! Ali Ababwa<br>
				Heard your princess was a sight lovely to see<br>
				And that, good people, is why he got dolled up and dropped by<br>
				With sixty elephants, llamas galore<br>
				With his bears and lions<br>
				A brass band and more<br>
				With his forty fakirs, his cooks, his bakers<br>
				His birds that warble on key<br>
				Make way for prince Ali!<br>
			</div>
