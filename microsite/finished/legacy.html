		<p>Coco Chanel greatly influenced women's fashion. Specifically she influenced women and men.  Women now had more freedom in what they were supposed to wear; they could dress how they wanted. Her fashion also helped the creation of other fashion, she inspired others to not only expand on the fashion of the time but to continue to evolve fashion. Coco Chanel made it so menswear could also be worn as womenswear, this was a huge step because it helped show how women and men were equal. She freed the ankles, loosened the waistline, allowed women to be able to cut their hair, and she just gave them so much freedom to do so much more. <p>

		<p>She influenced men due to the fact that she proved women were capable of more than just being housewives. They could work and do just as much as men, they just hadn't been given the opportunity. I think that while Chanel didn't change how men thought about women, she opened their eyes to a new point of view. </p>
 
		<p>"In order to be irreplaceable one must always be different." I think this quote is really important because it shows how she defied the societal norm.
