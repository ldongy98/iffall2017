	<h1> Feedback </h1>
	<li>The background color goes really well with the theme of the Korean fried chicken </li>
	<li>Maybe more exploration on the font the top of the "my korean recipe" since that is different from the rest of the text</li>
	<li>Maybe little bit more space between the lines</li>
	<li>In terms of margin, left side seems to have more margin than right.</li>
	<h2> Planned Directions </h2>
	<li>Explore font size and line height to create hierarchy</li>
	<li>Explore margin</li>
