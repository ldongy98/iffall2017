	<h1>Feedback to Minju</h1>
	<p>
		1. font color works really well
		<br>
		2. For the second images, since the color on the bottom has strong red, so maybe use similiar red color 
		<br>
		3. possibly to have darker shadow. 
		<br>
		4. for the last image, maybe try to move the text so that it is clear who is saying the quotes.
