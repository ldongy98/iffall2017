	<h1>Feedback to Minju</h1>
	<p>
		1. font color works really wellThe big image on very top of the page can be cropped. Because the outfocused part of the image takes half of the image, it is kind of distracting.
		<br>
		2. For the second images, since the color on the bottom has strong red, so maybe use similiar red color 
		<br>
		3. possibly to have darker shadow. 
		<br>
		4. for the last image, maybe try to move the text so that it is clear who is saying the quotes.
